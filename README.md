    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    The gaming room wanted me to create a game for multiple people to play called draw it or lose it that allowed people to guess on an image that was being shown on screen the game was written in java and used maven the cost had to be kept low on the project as the company didnt have many funds
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    I felt like in the documentation i explained how i would apply the needs of the gaming room to the project effectively so that they would know that i took their needs seriouely and i was trying to think about what the most effective way to create such a game while staying within their budget and on the platform they chose.
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    the design document helped me figure out what tasks needed to be done in the code which is incredibly helpful otherwise i wouldnt have known where to start
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    If i could change part of my work on the documents i would change then i would liek to do more work on ther server side stuff since it seems incredibly useful to learn how to do
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    I took the users need into account when I was working on the code as i needed to add teams and players to the game so that players could guess on the pictures.
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    We used a singleton in the code which could be used when we only want something to be used once in the code and never agin which is quite useful for making sure that an operation only happend a single time and not more than that.
